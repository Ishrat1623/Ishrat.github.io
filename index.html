            <h3>01. Microstrip Patch Antenna for Breast Cancer Detection.</h3>
            <h5>Authors: Ishrat Jahan, Md Ahasan Kabir</h5>
            <p>The most diagnosed cancer among women worldwide is breast cancer. X-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound are all medical procedures that have a few numbers of drawback. In this research, a microstrip patch antenna operating in ISM frequency range along with two types of 3D breast phantom has been created using CST microwave studio in order to identifying the presence of the malignant tumor. The aim of this paper is to detect the cancerous tumor in breast phantom by the variation of S11 parameters & SAR analysis. To reach this goal other parameters such as efficiency, reflection parameters, SAR have been evaluated. As reflection coefficient varies in the presence of tumor in the breast phantom & SAR value is higher for tumor cells, the tumor can be easily detected in this process.Detecting the cancerous tumor in this process is better than other processes because biological tissues remain harmless due to the non-ionizing nature of microwave.

            <h3>02. DESIGN of A SLOTTED PATCH CIRCULAR ANTENNA ARRAY
                for BREAST TUMOR IDENTIFICATION.</h3>
            <h5>Authors: Ishrat Jahan, Md. Omar Faruk Noman, Md Ahasan Kabir</h5>
            <p>Breast cancer has been one of the main causes of death in women in the last few decades, highlighting the need for more accurate methods of early detection that can facilitate more rapid and efficient treatment. X-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound are all diagnostic tools for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. But they are constrained in some ways. For example, X-ray mammography, the most popular breast screening procedure, can miss cancer detection due to low tissue contrast and radiation exposure. In comparison to X-ray mammography, microwave imaging is safer for patients and offers higher detection rates. MBI utilizes differences in the electrical characteristics of fatty breast tissues and abnormal ones to diagnose breast cancer. This paper compares and contrasts four different microstrip patch antennas operating at 2.45 GHz for use in microwave breast imaging in the ISM frequency band. These antennas can identify tumors by analyzing and comparing their s-parameter, E-field, H-field, radiation pattern, and specific absorption rate (SAR). By placing each antenna separately on the breast skin and analyzing the field values and surface current density differences between the healthy and malignant tissue of the breast phantom designed and simulated in CST STUDIO SUITE, a single antenna is selected for the six-element antenna array to increase tumor detection sensitivity.

            <h3>03. Design & Analysis of an Octagonal Slotted Patch Microstrip Antenna for Brain Tumor Detection.</h3>
            <h5>Authors: Ishrat Jahan, Md. Omar Faruk Noman, Mahabub-E-Sanjida Tasnim, Md Ahasan Kabir</h5>
            <p>Brain tumor causes unexpected death throughout the world. Early detection can reduce the mortality rate significantly. This research paper has presented a miniatured, slotted octagonal-shaped, single-fed wearable antenna designed to operate in the 2.45 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band to detect and localize brain tumors. The designed antenna is small in size, wide bandwidth, and has promising parameter results for distinguishing between healthy and contaminated brain tissues. To create a prominent antenna and human head phantom model CST Microwave Studio Suite has been used. FR-4 is specifically chosen as the substrate for its flexibility, while copper is utilized for both the patch and the ground. The proposed octagon-shaped slotted antenna has a dimension of 43× 40× 8.8 mm3. FR-4 has been used as substrate and copper is employed for both the patch and the ground. Six uniform layers of Skin, Fat, Skull, Dura, CSF, and Brain have been incorporated to ensure patient safety. The proposed antenna has been tested using a simulated model of the human head. The simulation results have found a return loss of -50.55db at operation frequency 2.45gHz with around 85% lower Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value than the permissible value. The return loss, radiation pattern, E-Field, H-Field and SAR of the proposed wearable antenna are measured and compared to those of a head phantom model with a 4mm and 6mm tumor implanted in a human brain to simulate the effects of cancer. There is a significant difference in the values of the simulated result between the three scenarios: with and without tumor, with different tumor size, and with varying tumor location relative to the antenna. By analyzing these simulated data, the tumor's location can be determined effectively.
